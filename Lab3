Job Posting that Iâ€™m interested in: Salesforce Developer
Planning for the interview: job posting requires having knowledge of analysis, design, development, and configuration of function. In order to gain this, I have to start working on application design and development skill. For that I might have to work for other position to gain that experience. This job is for developer, so I have to improve my communication skill and problem-solving skill in group. It requires at least s1 year experience in development, so I have to starting to work on that. On sales force website actually, you can start taking there certificate course. So this going to help me lot during interview. They have lot of different certificate on there website like junior developer and if you reach at several point you can apply for senior level job. This will be my turning point if I start doing right now. I still need to learn Apex and Visualforce in order to get the senior developer job. I started working on sales force certificate so that would be my plus point on resume when I apply for the job. so for the Apex and Visualforce I have to learn that from online course or I have to register the class where they teach this.
