In preparation for Lab #1 our group in last decided that we would be developing application for atm location and it is fees. That how much they charge for each transaction, if it is not that bank ATM means if you use chase bank atm card and if you use that card at some corner store. at first when we got in to zoom breakout room, first couple of minutes was chaotic. Because it is like we bounded in to one room with no one to handle question or no management. everyone was speaking and expressing idea but at the same time so first couple of minutes were chaotic. After that, few people step up to manage stuff like. raise the hand if anyone want to express their idea and some people prefer chat. so that helped us in many ways. Until we decided to do that there were many people were quiet because couple of other guys are already expressing their idea. Before we end the zoom meeting, we decided to do further discussion for future day in discord group because everyone has different availability of time.
We have different idea of what to design. From that two idea is really on the top was atm application and other considered idea were locating the e-waste and locating the public bathroom. So, after discussing for a while, we decided to do what majority people want to go with which idea. Finally, we left with two idea one is e-waste and other is universal ATM locator. We discussed both idea and what are important of both applications, also what already available in the market. And what people needed now not just in NYC but in USA. After discussing and expressing what is important and why we decided to go with universal ATM location. So the end product we decided was to app should access public API to locate any ATMs in that area, labeling what bank it affiliated with, and how they charge for the transaction as an example some charge $ 1.00 or $ 1.75 it is vary from different area and different location. People who are using that app also have option to filter out the ATMs location from how much fees they charge. 
So, before we start wondering that where to start this project. We decided that we will get divided in to the two groups. One group handle front end and another group would do back end. As we progress in to building the program compare to other people some people have initiated most. Let’s just say that because everyone have different method and different comfort zone when speaking int o public or in large group.
I felt that splitting into small group helped collaboration better because when you have less people to work with you know start getting a better idea about the people you are working with. How they think and what they want to do. its like when you have large group it not easy to have mutual understanding with everyone. After we done the zoom breakout room, we decided that we will do more work together through discord group. So, we don’t have to find mutual time. Because everyone has different availability of time. In discord bord one guy who write every important points. Which group is doing what part?
As a group we must do understanding with other people idea. As some people did what they want to do. whole group must come to mutual understanding to finish the project and reach the goal. As a whole group I felt everyone was doing their work and everyone was taking every chance to initiate what they can. Working as a group most important is you more brain working at a same time. Sometimes your idea differs from each other but at the end of the day your goal is same. So that benefits a lot in group vs working individually.
